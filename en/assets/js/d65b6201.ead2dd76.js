While cookie bomb attacks alone may not be very impactful, when combined with other elements, they can potentially lead to severe vulnerabilities. For example, we have previously seen how same-site websites can bypass same-site cookie restrictions and exploit CORS limitations through parsing issues in the ",(0,n.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"content-type")," header, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"The first case I want to introduce appeared in a talk by filedescriptor at HITCON CMT in 2019: ",(0,n.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njQcVWPB1is&ab_channel=HITCON"},"The cookie monster in your browsers"),"."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"He discovered an XSS vulnerability on ",(0,n.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"example.com"),", which used Google OAuth for login.
